# k-Vertex-Disjoint-Path-Problem
(Attempts to solve an NP-complete problem)

You are given a directed graph with n = 100 nodes and k = 10 pairs of nodes (a1, b1),...,(ak, bk). Your task is to find k paths
from a1 to b1, from a2 to b2, etc. such as no two paths use the same node, although endpoints are allowed to overlap. Show
that this problem is NP-complete. Also show that this problem is easy if you simply want k paths from a nodes to b nodes.
